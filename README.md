## Introduction

This repository contains the backend code for a movie booking 
application called Book My Show (BMS). The project aims to provide a 
user-friendly code that allows users to discover, select and book movie
tickets. The backend handles core functionalities such as,

- Creating users 
- Creating cities
- Creating theatres
- Creating auditoriums (corresponding to theatres)
- Creating shows
- Adding seats (with categories) to the auditoriums
- and much more...
